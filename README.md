The Automated Map Generation Program is a Python-core program used to produce a variety of customizable meteorological maps, originally based on my freshman coursework. It allows users to use raw data from a variety of sources in the backend of the program, automatically compiling them and saving them as high-definition images. With a variety of interchangeable modules to handle the program's many mapping capabilities, adding and editing functionality to your own version is as simple as learning Python and finding your data.

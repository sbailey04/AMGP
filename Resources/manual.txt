# How to use AMGP's time mechanics:            #
# AMGP uses a variety of synchronization       #
# methods to display information in the most   #
# useful ways possible, but they can be a bit  #
# difficult to use at first. Below is a guide  #
# to the different Time Mode, Convective Mode, #
# Delta, and Date parameters.                  #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# Date:                                        #
# Date is input "{YYYY} {MM} {DD} {HH} {mm}"   #
# and displayed "YYYY, MM, DD, HH, mm" on the  #
# interface. Minutes are optional, as only     #
# certain Time and Convective Modes can use    #
# them.                                        #
# "recent" and "today {HH} {mm}" are also      #
# accepted as dates. Minutes are optional once #
# again.                                       #
# When used with the MMG Module, Date          #
# represents the OLDEST data point.            #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# Delta:                                       #
# Delta specifies the number of hours after    #
# the time given by Date that gridded data     #
# should pull forecast data for.               #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# Time Mode:                                   #
# There are four individual Time Modes which   #
# AMGP uses: "raw", "async", "sync", and       #
# "near".                                      #
#                                              #
# "raw": The raw Time Mode is the simplest, as #
# it pulls only data available for the exact   #
# date and time specified by the Date          #
# parameter. Most Factors have a hard time     #
# using this Time Mode, but satelite data is   #
# particularly well-suited for it, if it is    #
# the only thing being plotted.                #
#                                              #
# "async": The asynchronous Time Mode is the   #
# most widely-usable Time Mode, as it displays #
# the most recent update of all parameters     #
# given, at the same time. Keep in mind,       #
# however, that this means the data displayed  #
# will NOT be taken at the same time, for most #
# Factors.                                     #
#                                              #
# "sync": The synchronized Time Mode presents  #
# the most recent data of each Factor at the   #
# time of the OLDEST data within those Factors #
# - usually, this means the Factor which is    #
# updated least frequently of the ones input.  #
#                                              #
# "near": The nearest Time Mode is a rather    #
# niche Time Mode, functioning as effectively  #
# and opposite to the synchronized Time Mode;  #
# only data updated at the same time as the    #
# MOST-NEWLY-UPDATED will be displayed with    #
# this Time Mode.                              #
# This Time Mode could potentially be useful   #
# for a repeatedly-running script, as it will  #
# only display the most recently-updated data  #
# on each run.                                 #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# Convective Mode:                             #
# There are two Convective Modes that work     #
# alongside AMGP's Time Modes, and are used    #
# exclusively for SCP Convective Outlooks.     #
# They are "recent" and "latest".              #
#                                              #
# "recent": The recent Convective Mode simply  #
# pulls the most recent Convective Outlook at  #
# the requested product time.                  #
#                                              #
# "latest": The latest Convective Mode pulls   #
# pulls the most recent Convective Outlook     #
# with reference to the time at which the user #
# creates the product. For a product within    #
# the last 24 hours, this means that is simply #
# behaves just like the "recent" Convective    #
# Mode. However, for product dates beyond that #
# it pulls the last Convective Outlook that    #
# was released that day.                       #
#                                              #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# The Multi-Mode GIF Module has several        #
# time-related parameters of its own, though   #
# they are simpler than the Time Mode and      #
# Convective Mode.                             #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# EndDate:                                     #
# In the same format as Date, EndDate          #
# specifies the date and time past which no    #
# more maps should be generated for the run.   #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# DeltaLoop:                                   #
# DeltaLoop specifies the gap, in hours,       #
# between each forecast run for gridded data.  #
# If gridded data is not being used, or        #
# forecast runs are not desired, this should   #
# be left at "0".                              #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# TimeStep:                                    #
# TimeStep is similar to DeltaLoop, but rather #
# specifies the gaps in the base times for     #
# data gathering. When used in tandem with     #
# DeltaLoop, gridded data can be shown one a   #
# much smoother time scale than the initial    #
# runs.                                        #
#                                              #
#                                              #
# DeltaMax:                                    #
# DeltaMax specifies the maximum distance      #
# forecast hours should go in advance of the   #
# base time.                                   #
